"""
This program includes a function to test
whether a given codeword string is a valid encoding
of a given original string using a Caesar cipher.

It returns an integer value, indicating the
forward shift (e.g A (original) -> B (codeword)
is a forward shift of 1).

It is assumed that the original string and codeword string
both comprise only capitalized English letters A-Z.

It is also assumed that neither the original string
nor the codeword string is the empty string.

A valid encoding results in a return value
in the range 0-25, indicating the forward shift
value used in the cipher.
A return value of 0 indicates a valid Caesar cipher
that used no shift at all.

A -1 is returned to indicate that the given
codeword string is not a valid encoding of the original
string using a Caesar cipher.

The function has bug(s).

There are no tests (yet).

Your job is to
1) include in this program a sufficient
suite of pass/fail tests to thoroughly
test the function and expose all error(s).

2) Generate a screenshot that
demonstrates your use of a debugger
to step through the function. Specifically it should
illustrate the execution point of a test at
which the function makes (or is about to make)
a mistake.

3) fix the code and document your fix(es).
Include additional tests if you feel it
necessary to thoroughly test the function.

You will submit your updated version of this
file (along with a separate document containing
the screenshot and answered questions).
